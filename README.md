## Problem Solutions

### Problem 1: Matrix Operations with Conditions
**File**: `problem1.m`

**Objective**: Create a 5×5 random matrix and modify elements based on index conditions:
- If i = j: set value to i² + j²
- If i > j: set value to i² + j
- If i < j: set value to i + j²

**Key Features**:
- Random 5×5 matrix initialization
- Conditional element modification using nested loops
- Sum calculation and display

### Problem 2: Color-Coded Matrix Visualization
**File**: `problem2.m`

**Objective**: Generate a 10×10 random integer matrix (1-100) and create a color-coded visualization:
- Values 1-33: Blue (color code 1)
- Values 34-66: Green (color code 2)
- Values 67-100: Red (color code 3)

**Key Features**:
- Random integer matrix generation (1-100)
- Color mapping based on value ranges
- Visual matrix representation with colormap

### Problem 3: Trigonometric Function Plotting
**File**: `problem3.m`

**Objective**: Create subplots for sine, cosine, and tangent functions over the range -2π to 2π with π/2 intervals.

**Key Features**:
- X-axis values from -2π to 2π using `linspace`
- Three separate subplots for sin(x), cos(x), and tan(x)
- Proper labeling, titles, and legends
- Handling of tangent function asymptotes

**Plot Details**:
- X-range: -2π to 2π with π/2 intervals
- Subplot arrangement: 3×1 vertical layout
- Individual titles, axis labels, and legends for each subplot


## Challenges Faced
- **Color Mapping**: Creating appropriate color schemes for value ranges
- **Subplot Management**: Proper spacing and labeling of multiple plots
- **Asymptote Handling**: Managing tangent function discontinuities

## Learning Outcomes
- Mastered MATLAB matrix operations and indexing
- Learned conditional programming in MATLAB
- Gained experience with MATLAB plotting and visualization
- Understanding of subplot creation and management
- Developed skills in random number generation and data manipulation

## Certification
- ✅ MATLAB Onramp course completed

## Guidelines Followed
- ✅ Used institute email ID for all MATLAB/MathWorks access
- ✅ Refrained from direct code copying
- ✅ Used debugging assistance only when necessary
